For our Group Project, SHane and i decided to make a Wheel of Fortune console app.
The idea of the game is to have up to 3 contestents that take turns spinning the wheel and guessing a letter.
a correct guess will be worth which ever value the wheel lands on.  Players can keep spiining until they guess
incorrectly or land on 'Lose a turn' or 'Bankrupt'

ITs not quite working yet but idealy each game will consist of 3 different puzzles and the winner will be the one with
the highest dollar ammount at the end.
